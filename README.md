### Liquor License Helper for NYC Community Boards

The Liquor License Helper produces a printable summary report for use by Brooklyn Community Boards in liquor licensing discussions. For any given address, the helper finds details of churches within ~200ft and licensed properties within ~500ft.

Try it at [fkh.github.io/liquorinfo](http://fkh.github.io/liquorinfo/). Code is in the gh-pages branch.

This is a beta (alpha?), proof of concept, with tons of obvious holes. [Feedback strongly invited](https://github.com/fkh/liquorinfo/issues).
